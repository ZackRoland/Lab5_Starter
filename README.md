1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Yes I would use a unit test to test the message feature of a messaging application. First off we need to make sure that the button is actually working so that the message button actually sends the text to the recipient. Additonally we want to make sure when the text is sent that the formatting and what not is actually consistent and doesn't jumble up everything. Thirdly, you want to make sure that even if the sender is able to see the message being sent that the recipent also is able to view it as well. Theres a plethora of other reasons to include unit testing.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Absolutely you would use unit testing to test the max message length feature of a messaging application. You want to make sure that it encapsulates all valid characters whether it be standard numbers, puncutation and letters or emojis and text from other languages as well.
